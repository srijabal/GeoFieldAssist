GeoFieldAssist is a simple, AI-powered app designed to make geological fieldwork easier and faster. With just a photo of a rock, the app uses AI to identify the rock type and provide a description. After this, you can add structural measurements like strike, dip, and structure type, along with any extra notes. All this data is neatly saved in a table for easy access later. You can also record voice notes to capture quick thoughts or observations during your survey. It also has a 3D stereonet for better understanding on the globe. GeoFieldAssist helps geologists save time, reduce errors, and keep all their field data organized in one place.
